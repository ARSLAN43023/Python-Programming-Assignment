    "Define Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:<br /> An object-oriented programming is a high level programming,language based on the object-oriented model. It is a paradigm based on \n",
    "the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields \n",
    "(known as attributes)and in the form of procedures (known as methods).In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. Many modern programming languages are object-oriented,however some older programming languages, such as Pascal, do offer object-oriented versions.<br /> Examples of object-oriented programming \n",
    "languages include Java, C++ and Python.\n"

    "•\tOOP is faster and easier to execute<br />\n",
    "•\tOOP provides a clear structure for the programs<br />\n",
    "•\tOOP helps to keeps the code easier to maintain, modify and debug<br />\n",
    "•\tOOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time<br />\n",
    "•\tOOP enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added.<br />\n",
    "•\tThrough inheritance, we can eliminate the redundant code and extend the use of existing code.<br />\n",
    "•\tIn OOP data hiding (Encapsulation) concept help the programmer to build the secure code <br />\n",
    "•\tSoftware complexity can be easily managed<br />\n"
